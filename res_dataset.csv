The ultimate goal is to create new planning sensibilities, which theorize from practice, not the other way around.;19;100;

;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/11-s955-the-sustainability-response-to-covid-19-january-iap-2021/;The Sustainability Response to COVID-19;11.S955;Graduate;This course explores the importance of public transportation to social and economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and seeks to identify approaches to restoring transit ridership, with a focus on Metro Boston. We will attempt to (1) understand whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic can advance sustainable mobility, and specifically the role(s) of public transportation in the COVID-19 recovery process, and (2) identify policies and/or interventions that may encourage pre-COVID transit riders to return to transit and attract net new transit ridership.;19;100;

;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/12-007-geobiology-spring-2013/;Geobiology;12.007;Undergraduate;This course introduces the parallel evolution of life and the environment. Life processes are influenced by chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and the solid earth. In turn, life can influence chemical and physical processes on our planet. This course explores the concept of life as a geological agent and examines the interaction between biology and the earth system during the roughly 4 billion years since life first appeared.;11;18;

The first of two phases challenges each student team to meet a set of design requirements and constraints for a structural component. A course of iteration, fabrication, and validation completes this manual design cycle. During the second phase, each team conducts design optimization using structural analysis software, with their phase one prototype as a baseline.
