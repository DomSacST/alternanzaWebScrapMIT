Topics include coevolution of the biosphere, geosphere, atmosphere and oceans, photosynthesis and respiration, the hydrologic, carbon and nitrogen cycles. We will examine the flow of energy and materials through ecosystems, regulation of the distribution and abundance of organisms, structure and function of ecosystems, including evolution and natural selection, metabolic diversity, productivity, trophic dynamics, models of population growth, competition, mutualism and predation. This course is designated as Communication-Intensive, instruction and practice in oral and written communication provided.
